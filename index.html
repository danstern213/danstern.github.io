        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a jack of all trades and a veteran of technology companies.  I currently lead 
            Customer Success at a Healthtech startup called <a href="https://www.adonis.io">Adonis.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I previously co-founded and led Product for a sports tech company that was acquired by <a href="http://www.Beckett.com">Beckett</a>.
            Before that I worked at Palantir, doing everything from demoing and selling supply chain readiness workflows,
            writing PySpark across billions of rows, and tracking spend for the Army.  I started my career in operations at Jet.com, then 
            quickly found myself in <a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-path-for-you-to-learn-analytics-and-data-skills-bd48ccde7325">analytics</a> 
            and then managing the P&L for their $50M grocery delivery business.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in everything from:
            <li>Geopolitics</li>
            <li>Stoic and Existentialist Philosophy</li>
            <li>History and the origins of traditions</li>
            <li>How societies organize, grow and prosper</li>
            <li>Tennis</li>
            <br>
            
            I also enjoy tinkering with new software - I've built AI powered image recognition tools
            on Bubble and a personal chatbot trained on top of my own notes.
